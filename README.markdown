Try it out live [here](http://www.prism.gatech.edu/~gth716h/FlightForm)

A simple example of MVC architecture using backbone.js.

This application lets you fill out a form, each submission is a new instance of the flight model.
The viewer turns those models into individual div blocks in a list, as shown in real-time on the page
The controller/router controls the popping/alert and removal of flights from the list etc.
